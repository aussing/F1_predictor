# F1_predictor


This is a personal project to figure out if and how I can use F1 practice and qualifying data to predict race outcomes. The inspiration for this project came initally from seeing [Tom Shaw's F1 race replay](https://github.com/IAmTomShaw/f1-race-replay) project, combined with playing last year's (2025) F1 fantasy (I came second but I think there's room for improvement).

The plan is to use the [FastF1](https://docs.fastf1.dev/index.html) Python package to acesss the data, then create a machine learning model to attempt to predict the final race order. This is my first ever project using any type of machine learning, and I would consider myself a fairly average python coder, so wish me luck.

TO DO list:
1. Write script to download relevant data
2. Transform said data into useful machine learning inputs
3. Create the worlds best prediction machine, win F1 fantasy league

Whether or not this is up and running in time for the 2026 season remains to be seen, but we'll see how it goes.
